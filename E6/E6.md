The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385" /> 
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(1 + 2 + .. + 10)^2 = 3025" />
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?3025 - 285 = 2640" />
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
